    "For this homework, we will learn a bit about protein coding genes and transcripts in the human genome by working with a [GTF](https://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html) file from Ensembl that describes all of the protein coding and non coding genes that have been annotated for human. Now, we know that most have more than one isoform, and accordingly, this GTF reports information about the exons, introns, and UTRs of each transcript for each gene. But first, a couple of warm-up questions."

    "Let's start by downloading this GTF file from Ensemble using a new UNIX command called `curl`. [curl](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/curl.htm) transfers data from a remote file (i.e., on an FTP or HTTP site) directly to your terminal. In other words, it is the command line way of going to a website and downloading something. This command is super useful because most real world analyses require getting data or annotations from other resources such as the UCSC genome browser.\n",

    "Now, notice that the filename ends in `.gz`. This means that it is compressed with a program called `gzip`. If you have ever used the compression utilities on your Mac or Windows machine, you have likely seen files that end with `.zip`. This is the exact same concept, but `.gz` file were compressed with a slightly different tool. So, before we get started, we have to first `decompress` this file into a plain old text file (in GTF format as we discuss in class) that we can easily work with using the UNIX commands we have learned thus far. We do this as follows using yet another new UNIX command called `gzip`. The `-d` option tells `gzip` to decompress the file."
